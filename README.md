# Quiz Game

#### I built this quiz game following a tutorial to get more comfortable with React.  
#### It helped me practice things like useEffect, useState, useCallback, passing props, conditional rendering, computed values, conditional statements, and working with timers.  

#### I added lots of notes in the files to help me remember and learn better :D
